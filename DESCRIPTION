Description: Computational package accompanying the paper "Metabolic
    stress primes cancer by rebalancing cell and tissue functions". MATCHA
    allows the user to uncover and prioritize transcription factors that
    are "central hubs" regulating multiple user-specified gene programs
    and specific cellular/tissue phenotypes. MATCHA: 1) leverages cell
    type- and/or tissue-specific transcriptomic and epigenetic
    relationships, towards capturing context-specific regulatory
    interactions, 2) can emphasize robust and generalizable gene program
    drivers by incorporating datasets spanning studies, cohorts and
    species, and, 3) can uncover core, co-regulatory TFs capable of
    activating or repressing each of multiple gene programs
    simultaneously.
